Free Unix!
==========

In 1983, Richard Stallman began the free software movement
with these words. He said that he would begin to write
a **fully free** alternative to Unix.

-----

The Unix Philosophy
===================

-   Develop modular software that does one thing really well.

-   Write programs that work together.

-   Focus on handling text streams, a universal interface.

-   Keep it simple, stupid.

-----

Free software -- remember -- is not just "open source".

What makes it different?

**Licensing and user freedom.**

-----

The Four Freedoms
=================

0.  For any purpose.

1.  Study and modify.

2.  Distribute copies.

3.  Distribute changes.

-----

A brief history of GNU/Linux
============================

.. this would go AT&T/Unix --> GNU --> Linux.

-----

Free software and cloud computing
=================================

Free software advocates generally oppose cloud services
as they require you to host your personal data on a server
outside of your control.

Elastic computing is fine, as long as you have full control
over the servers you're spinning up.

Distributed solutions are acceptable, such as MediaGoblin.

-----

Freedom is crucial.
===================

Free society through liberation of:

-   Software

-   Content

-   Language

-   Thought

-----

The importance of user freedom
==============================

.. this is where we would have the discussion of priviledge vs freedom.

-----

License, License, License.
==========================

.. perhaps reiterate importance of licensing and give some examples.
